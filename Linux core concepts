What is a kernel  (use uname and uname -r )
 - nucleus of the OS
 - intermediate between Application users/processes and the underlying hardware

Kernel functions : 
    - Memory Management
    - divided into below
        - Kernel space (Kernel, Device Drivers)
        - user space (Applications/Programs)
        - For e.g cat /etc/dummy.txt(user space) - > calls the kernel (kernel space) : System calls : Device drivers (kernel space) - > Hardware (block device) 

Working with hardware (This is very specific to the Linux kernel)
    - dmesg - shows all the boot logs. 
    - udevadm info  --query=path --name=/dev/sda5 (to get info about the hardware)
    - udevadm monitor (listen to kernel uvents[this can attaching a usb, removing a usb mouse etc. ] . Determines details of newly attached device)

lspci(peripheral components interconnect)
 - e.g. graphic card, ethernet cable etc.  

lsblk 
 - list all the block devices and their partition

lscpu 
 - information of the cpu

To check memory 
 - lsmem -- summary
 - free -m 

 lshw
  - tool to extract entire hardware information on the machine
